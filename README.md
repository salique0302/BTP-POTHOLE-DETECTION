# Pothole Detection System

## Overview

The **Pothole Detection System** is a cutting-edge solution leveraging deep learning techniques to identify potholes in road images or video feeds. By analyzing road surfaces, it provides accurate binary classification: roads with potholes and plain roads without potholes. This system aids in improving road maintenance processes by enabling automated and real-time pothole detection.

## Features

- **Real-time Image Classification**: Detects potholes in road images on the fly.
- **Deep Learning-Powered**: Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized model with robust performance metrics.
- **Visual Predictions**: Displays predictions along with confidence scores.
- **Extendable Framework**: Designed for further enhancements, like pothole localization and advanced object detection.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. **Model Architecture**

The CNN model consists of:

- **Input Layer**: Grayscale images of size 100x100 pixels.
- **Convolutional Layers**:
  - 16 filters with ReLU activation (8x8 kernel, stride 4x4).
  - 32 filters with ReLU activation (5x5 kernel, same padding).
- **Global Average Pooling Layer**.
- **Dense Layers**:
  - 512 neurons with 0.1 dropout.
  - 2 neurons for binary classification with softmax activation.

### 2. **Data Processing Pipeline**

- **Image Preprocessing**:
  - Grayscale conversion, resizing to 100x100 pixels, and normalization.
- **Data Augmentation**: Splitting into training and validation sets.
- **Label Encoding**: Categorical encoding for binary classification.

## Dataset

The dataset is organized as follows:

- **Training Data**:
  - Pothole images: `My Dataset/train/Pothole/`
  - Plain road images: `My Dataset/train/Plain/`
- **Testing Data**:
  - Pothole images: `My Dataset/test/Pothole/`
  - Plain road images: `My Dataset/test/Plain/`

## Performance Metrics

The system evaluates performance using:

- **Classification Accuracy**
- **Prediction Confidence Scores**
- **Real-time Processing Speed**

---

## Limitations

- Binary classification only (presence or absence of potholes).
- Fixed input size of 100x100 pixels.

---

## Future Enhancements
